# Godot Project Starter
## This project is forked from Cogito and includes addons and libraries for making my game projects.

## Cogito
Cogito is a First Person Immersive Sim Template Project for Godot 4, providing a framework for creating interactable objects, various items to use and mechanics to influence the player and game environment.
In short, with COGITO you get a quick start for a fully-featured first person game with a great variety of mechanics and a solid base to create your own.
